# 📦 Velesio AI Server

**Velesio** is a next-generation AI integration framework for Unity developers, built to simplify and supercharge the way games interact with powerful language and diffusion models.

Whether you're building immersive NPCs, intelligent agents, or AI-driven tools, Veles gives you a seamless plug-and-play interface to tap into both local and cloud-hosted AI systems — all from within Unity.

With this repo you can locally host your own llamacpp and Stable Diffusion server which can seemlessly connect to Unity, using the [Velesio Unity AIntegration](https://github.com/Velesio/Velesio-UnityAIntegration)

[Runpod template](https://www.runpod.io/console/explore/07cky3lznr) to host self-host this in the cloud.

[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/teocholakov/velesio-aiserver)

To build this locally and self-host simply docker compose up --build

## 🧱 Built On the Shoulders of Great Open-Source

Veles would not be possible without the amazing work from the open-source community. Special thanks to:

- 🧠 [**LLM for Unity**](https://github.com/undreamai/LLMUnity) by *Undream AI* (MIT License)  
  A streamlined interface for integrating LLMs into Unity.

- 🎨 [**Stable-Diffusion-Unity-Integration**](https://github.com/dobrado76/Stable-Diffusion-Unity-Integration) by *Dobrado76* (Apache 2.0)  
  A powerful image-generation pipeline with Stable Diffusion.

- 🎨 [**AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui**](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

Their projects serve as a foundation and inspiration for this unified framework.
